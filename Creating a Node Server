const http = require('http');

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {

    console.log(req);
});
server.listen(5999); //listen starts a prpcess, where node js will not execute directly, it will listen first
// listen takes some arguments , like port where u want to store and hostname, hostname is the machine 

/* function rqListener(req, res) {

}
http.createSever(rqListener); */ 

// this is another way of doing it, with anonymous funcvtion
// function without a name
// this is an event driven architecture


//request listered is a function that will execute for every incoming request
// rqlistener takes 2 arguments, 1) request : type incoming message , some object that represents the incoming request and allows us to read from the object 
// 2) object response - to send response from where we received
